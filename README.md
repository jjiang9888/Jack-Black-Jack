Blackjack is a classic card game where in its most simplest form the objective is to have cards that add up to and not exceeding 21. In this iteration, it's just the player going against the house. 

In its current form for the sake of MVP, I did not include betting/multiple players/niche blackjack rules like splitting.

Technologies used: HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT , I focused mainly on the javascript because in my opinion that is where the meat of the project code is. 

Future additions: Add refresh game function. Additional players, betting function. 

Hardest part of the project was deciding on how to set Ace default value and what to do when
it was more viable to count it as a 1 instead of 11.
